657.Judge Route Circle

---

Initially, there is a Robot at position (0, 0). Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot makes a circle, which means it moves back to **the original place**.

The move sequence is represented by a string. And each move is represent by a character. The valid robot moves are `R` (Right), `L` (Left), `U` (Up) and `D`(down). The output should be true or false representing whether the robot makes a circle.

**Example 1:**

```python
Input: "UD"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```python
Input: "LL"
Output: false
```

My code:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def judgeCircle(self, moves):
        """
        :type moves: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        p = [0, 0]
        for i in moves:
            if i == "U":
                p[1] = p[1] + 1
            elif i == "D":
                p[1] = p[1] - 1
            elif i == "L":
                p[0] = p[0] - 1
            elif i == "R":
                p[0] = p[0] + 1
        if p == [0, 0]:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

**note:**

1. This  code is about the element of list operation.
2. Notice the return boolean value is **T**rue or **F**alse.
